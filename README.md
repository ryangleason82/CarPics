## Car Pics

Another project from the "Modern React with Redux" course on Udemy. This project goes deep into form handling with React. Also touches on creating requests to an API.

### Handling Forms

- User click on something --> onClick
- User changes text in an input --> onChange
- User submits a form --> onSubmit

### Misc Notes

- No parentheses when we pass a callback function to an event handler like "onChange"
- Naming convention for event callbacks
  - (on), name of the element (Input), event that we are watching for (Change)
  - onInputChange
